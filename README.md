# Make server administration a little easier.
DCS Server Toolkit. Made for some server housekeeping on the box, not for in-game.
**Note: This tool and its code is not endorsed or affliated with any personnel from Eagle Dynamics of DCS and is not commissioned by Eagle Dynamics!**

**There is currently no stable release as the code is still being worked on. You may test it yourself by downloading: `main.py` and `.env`**

### Current Features

- Server Monitoring and Auto-restart if the server exec goes down.
- Update, Repair, and Close your server with a GUI!
- Discord Webhook Usage, let your players & admins know whats going on with the server!
- Easy installer for the dependencies (install.bat)

### Future Features
I plan on adding more capabilities such as:
- Automatic Server Update & Repair (when needed)
- Control via POST method
- and more (as I think of it.)

### Requirements
In order for this to work -- you will need the following dependencies:
- Python 3.10.X (this was built on 3.10.8)
- colorama
- dearpygui (future release)
- python-dotenv
- requests

### Code Warning
This tool is not meant to be production ready and really is just a personal project of mine to make my life easier with my own hosting of DCS Server. You are free to use it, the code just wont look very nice as I continue to learn Python!
Thanks for stopping by!
