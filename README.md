# dcsservtoolkit
DCS Server Toolkit. Made for some server housekeeping on the box, not for in-game.

**There is currently no stable release as the code is still being worked on. You may test it yourself by downloading: `main.py` and `path.txt`**

### Current Features
- Server Monitoring and Auto-restart if the server exec goes down.

### Future Features
I plan on adding more capabilities such as:
- Discord Webhooks
- Control via POST method
- and more (as I think of it.)

### Code Warning
This tool is not meant to be production ready and really is just a personal project of mine to make my life easier with my own hosting of DCS Server. You are free to use it, the code just wont look very nice as I continue to learn Python!
Thanks for stopping by!
